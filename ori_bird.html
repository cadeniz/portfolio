                        Ori Bird is a game that I developed using Unity. The goal of this project is to increase my familiarity with Unity and to better learn the Unity interface by creating a small project. Our hero in the game is named Ori. Ori is a bird made of origami. Tiny Ori flaps its wings, trying to reach its family. To move Ori up and down, simply using the space bar is sufficient.</p>

                        In this project, my aim was to gain familiarity with Unity and its elements. Before starting the project, I divided it into four phases: Initiating, Planning, Execute and Complete Tasks, and Close Project.<br> <br> 

                        During the Initiating phase, I made decisions about the game's name, genre, gameplay style, and the goals I wanted to achieve. I defined the purpose and scope of the project.<br> <br> 

                        In the Planning phase, I determined what I needed to create the game. I decided on the tasks and milestones for the project. Requirements included game codes, visual and audio materials.<br> <br> 

                        During the Execute and Complete Tasks phase, I created drawings related to Ori, found the sound files to be used in the game, and created the C# script files used in the game. I ensured there were no errors in the game by conducting tests. I debugged encountered issues, ensuring the game ran smoothly without errors.<br> <br> 

                        In the Close Project phase, after completing the project, I conducted a self-evaluation. I reflected on what went well, what didn't go well, and considered areas where I could improve.

                    <p class="SectionDetail">
			I developed a solid understanding of the Unity interface and its diverse components. I enhanced my capability to create scripts, manage events, and handle assets, leading to an understanding of the Unity environment. Incorporating Ori's drawings into the game required handling of visual assets. This hands-on experience improved my skills in importing, organizing, and seamlessly integrating visual, and audio elements within Unity. In summary, this project has been a journey of my growth in Unity environment and individual skill enhancement.
