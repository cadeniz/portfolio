                    <p class="SectionTitle">Problem</p>
                    <p class="SectionDetail">The problem at the heart of this project is the sense of isolation and loneliness that many individuals, particularly newcomers in a city or a country, often experience. While many social networking platforms are available, they typically cater to individuals who already have an established social circle. On the other hand, newcomers are often left on their own, struggling to form connections, find social events, or engage in community activities. This lack of social interaction can lead to negative emotional states, including feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression.
                        <br><br>
                        There is a significant gap in the market for a social engagement application that not only provides newcomers with easy access to local social activities but also promotes interaction, rewards participation, and allows for feedback and ratings for the events attended.</p>

Illustrator and Photoshop, with their expansive capabilities, were utilized for crafting detailed graphics and refining visual assets. Meanwhile, Slack played a pivotal role in team communication, ensuring real-time collaboration and feedback, and keeping everyone aligned with the project's goals and progress.</p>

                    <p class="SectionDetail">

                        The Buddy app project was an opportunity for me to wear multiple hats as a UI/UX Designer and Project Manager. Designing an interface that was visually appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly was a creative and fulfilling challenge. Meanwhile, as a project manager, I learned how to coordinate team activities, manage communication, and ensure we met our project deadlines.
                        <br>  <br>
                        Developing the app encompassed multiple stages, from ideation to completion. As part of the UI/UX design process, I created several UI assets and kits consistently applied throughout the app. As a Project Manager, I honed my team coordination, task allocation, and communication management skills using tools such as Slack and Figma. Balancing time constraints with team capabilities and ensuring the delivery of a high-quality product was a task that was as challenging as it was rewarding. Additionally, I had the opportunity to conduct a competitor analysis, devise a business plan, and strategize on potential future features.
                        <br>  <br>
                        In conclusion, the Buddy app project has significantly contributed to my growth as a UI/UX designer and a Project Manager. I applied my skills in a practical setting and gained hands-on experience in all aspects of product development. The lessons I've learned in strategic planning, user-centred design, and project management are invaluable and will undoubtedly be a strong foundation for my future endeavours. I look forward to leveraging these learnings in my upcoming projects, continuing to create intuitive designs that enhance user interactions and drive user engagement.
