Hello there! 👋<br><br>

🔍 With seven years of professional experience, I specialize in comprehensive reporting and proficient database management. Motivated by a passion for design aesthetics and an interest in crafting user-friendly experiences, I pursued an education in user experience and visual design. My goal is to develop user-focused solutions and create human-centred designs for end-users to address both business needs and user needs. <br><br>

👩🏻‍🏫 I further honed my skills by completing the Web and Mobile App Development post-baccalaureate program at Langara College, graduating with distinction. This immersive experience provided me with the technical skills necessary for development and a nuanced understanding of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design principles. <br><br>

🌟 I am driven by the prospect of creating solutions that positively impact businesses and am always eager to take on new challenges, pushing the boundaries of innovation.<br><br>
						
I'm always open for communication! If you have any questions, thoughts, or ideas, don't hesitate to connect with me on LinkedIn.
