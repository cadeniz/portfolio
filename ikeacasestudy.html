                        The image used on the homepage is too large, dominating the user's view and neglecting the screen sizes of mobile devices.
                        <br><br>
                        When clicking on a product shown on the homepage, the subsequent product detail page only includes the product image, some features, and the price. Other relevant information should be displayed to the user.
                        <br><br>
                        The structure of the product detail page should be consistent in the mobile app. Going to a different product page when clicking on a search result versus clicking on a product shown on the homepage is confusing for the user. 
                        <br><br>
                        The search results page, after performing a search, does not provide a suitable page for users to access the product. Instead of showing products in the searched category, it displays elements unrelated to the product.
                        <br><br>
                        When scrolling to the bottom of the homepage, there is no content or feature provided for the user after the main content ends. There is no quick scroll button to return to the top, requiring unnecessary effort from the user.
                        <br><br>
                        After adding a product to the cart and going to the cart section, there is a significant amount of unrelated content visible on the page. The product should be prominently displayed to the user. In the cart page, the "add everyday essentials" section is confusing. The customer cannot clearly see which products are in their cart.
                        <br><br>
                        The icon in the "data preferences" section of the settings does not have an appealing appearance.
                        <br><br>
                        To access the "change password" and "delete account" sections, the user needs to use the toggle first. This creates unnecessary effort for the user.

                        <br><br>
                        Solution<br><br>
                        After performing a search, I implemented a feature that displays the products first, allowing users to quickly find the item they are looking for. To maintain consistency within the application, I replaced the icon toggle used in the "Show Availabilities" section with a checkmark icon. This change was made because the checkmark icon is commonly associated with obtaining more information within the application, and users are likely to be familiar with it.

                        <br><br>
                        Solution<br><br>
                        Instead of showing an empty space when the user reaches the bottom of the main page, I enabled them to continue browsing by providing a direct link to the next category, which is the "Bedroom" tab. This allows users to easily discover other products and extends their engagement with the application, maximizing the time they spend on it.

                        After adding a product to the cart and going to the cart section, there is a significant amount of unrelated content visible on the page. The product should be prominently displayed to the user. In the cart page, the "add everyday essentials" section is confusing. The customer cannot clearly see which products are in their cart.
                        <br><br>
                        Solution<br><br>
                        I removed the detailed description field for products already in the user's cart. Displaying the product image, name, price, and quantity is sufficient for the existing items in the cart. Users can access the details by clicking the product image.
                        <br><br>
                        To make "add everyday essentials" more meaningful, I changed it to "Before payment, add everyday essentials." I removed unnecessary details about the product in this section, reduced the size of product images, and made it collapsible. This way, I created a simpler, more understandable, and user-friendly area.
                        <br><br>
                        For the payment-related warning message, I added an exclamation mark to draw the user's attention to this area.

                        Solution<br><br>
                        I redesigned the icon used on this page to create a more easily understandable icon that doesn't give the impression of being incomplete.

                        I moved the warning message to the top to ensure that users can easily see the informational message before pressing any buttons. I reduced the color intensity of the icons and initial content on the buttons, and increased the visibility of the words "change password" and "delete account" to make them more easily understandable.
